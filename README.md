TODO: 

I have some basic test scripts for a hard coded world. Need to make them automatically generate objects in good positions according to a desired spatial relationship.


Ideas / Thoughts:

Maybe have a free-for-all round at end of user demonstrations where we have human teach robot any task they want through demonstration and words. At worst, we throw this data away, at best we get some interesting spatial relationships that we didn't hand code into the experiments. This also gives us something more realistic since the human starts with a goal and then gives demonstrations, rather than being trained along the way. We could just give them a set of fixed objects that are randomly placed each time, or have them move the objects to set up each demonstration. Then ask them to give X demos of the task they want the robot to learn and a concise description of the task.
