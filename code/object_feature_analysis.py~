""" pure LfD idea:
    (1) First take every demonstration for a specific task and compute the intersection over featurized objects to see what remains constant.
    This sees if the same exact feature is present over all demonstrations.
    
    NOTE: maybe we should just look over each feature so maybe we see there is always a circle or even always two shapes of different colors, etc"
        This really blows up since anything could be possible. Ideally we want an LfD method that starts from simple and moves to complex. 
        First look at singletons then at pairs within objects, ... we could also look at colors aligned with positions, etc. How do you deal with this?
        Need some sort of prior.
